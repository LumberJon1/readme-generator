# Tech Blog
  ## Description
  The Tech Blog is an online blog where users can sign in, create accounts, and write posts about whatever tech topic they like.  The blog's homepage includes posts from users across the site, and allows other users to interact via comments.  Users also have access to a dashboard upon login where they can view all of the posts they have made, and edit any of the titles or contents of their prior posts, as well as add new ones that will be shared to other viewers' homepages.
